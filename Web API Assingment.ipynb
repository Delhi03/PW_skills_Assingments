    "**Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Increased interoperability: APIs allow different software systems to communicate with each other, regardless of their programming language or platform. \n",
    "Improved efficiency: APIs driven infrastructures enable developers to reuse code and functionality from existing software systems, saving time and reducing the amount of code that needs to be written from scratch.  \n",
    "Increased flexibility: APIs can be used to create custom solutions that meet the specific needs of a business or application.  \n",
    "New revenue streams: APIs can be used to generate new revenue streams by allowing third-party developers to access and use the data or functionality of a service. This can be a valuable way to monetize a service or product.  \n",
    "Improved security: APIs can be used to implement security measures, such as authentication and authorization, to protect data and systems. This can help to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or misuse of data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Security concerns: APIs can be a potential security risk, as they can be used to access sensitive data. It is important to implement appropriate security measures to protect data and systems.  \n",
    "Complexity: APIs can be complex to develop and use, especially for complex applications. This can be a barrier for some developers and businesses.  \n",
    "Dependency on third-party providers: APIs are often provided by third-party providers. This can create a dependency on these providers, which can be a risk if the provider goes out of business or changes their API.  \n",
    "Cost: APIs can be expensive to develop and maintain, especially for complex applications. This can be a barrier for some developers and businesses.  \n",
    "Limits and quotas: API providers often impose limits and quotas on the number of requests that can be made to an API. This can be a barrier for some applications, especially those that require a high volume of requests.  "

    "\n",
    "Protocol: APIs can use a variety of protocols, such as HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, and FTP. Web APIs typically use HTTP or HTTPS.  \n",
    "Data format: APIs can use a variety of data formats, such as JSON, XML, and CSV. Web APIs typically use JSON or XML.  \n",
    "Security: APIs can be secured using a variety of methods, such as authentication, authorization, and encryption. Web APIs are typically secured using HTTPS.  \n",

REST APIs can use any data format, but JSON and XML are the most common.  \n",
