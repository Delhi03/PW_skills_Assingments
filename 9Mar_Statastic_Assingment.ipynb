    "# Q3: Examples of Situations Where the Normal Distribution Might Be Used as a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of Situations:\n",
    "1. **Heights of People**: Heights of adult men and women tend to follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "2. **Test Scores**: Standardized test scores like the SAT or IQ scores often follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "3. **Measurement Errors**: Errors in measurements in various scientific experiments usually follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "4. **Blood Pressure**: The distribution of blood pressure readings in a healthy population can often be modeled using a normal distribution.\n",
    "5. **Daily Stock Returns**: The daily returns of stock prices for large, diversified portfolios are often assumed to be normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters of the Normal Distribution:\n",
    "- **Mean (\\(\\mu\\))**: This is the central value of the distribution. It determines the location of the peak of the curve. For example, if the average height of adult men is 70 inches, then \\(\\mu = 70\\).\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\))**: This measures the spread or dispersion of the distribution. It determines the width of the bell curve. A smaller \\(\\sigma\\) results in a steeper curve, while a larger \\(\\sigma\\) results in a flatter curve. For instance, if the standard deviation of heights is 3 inches, then \\(\\sigma = 3\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shape of the Distribution:\n",
    "- **Symmetry**: The normal distribution is symmetric about the mean.\n",
    "- **Bell-shaped Curve**: The highest point on the curve corresponds to the mean, and the curve tails off symmetrically on both sides.\n",
    "- **68-95-99.7 Rule**:\n",
    "  - About 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation (\\(\\mu \\pm \\sigma\\)) of the mean.\n",
    "  - About 95% falls within two standard deviations (\\(\\mu \\pm 2\\sigma\\)).\n",
    "  - About 99.7% falls within three standard deviations (\\(\\mu \\pm 3\\sigma\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Visualization:\n",
    "If we consider the heights of adult males with \\(\\mu = 70\\) inches and \\(\\sigma = 3\\) inches, the distribution will have its peak at 70 inches. About 68% of the males will have heights between 67 and 73 inches (70 \\(\\pm 3\\) inches), 95% will have heights between 64 and 76 inches (70 \\(\\pm 6\\) inches), and 99.7% will have heights between 61 and 79 inches (70 \\(\\pm 9\\) inches).\n",
