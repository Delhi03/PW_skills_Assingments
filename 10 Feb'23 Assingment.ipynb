    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.  \n",
    "Ans:  \n",
    "In python, the function used to open a file is typically called open(). The open() function allows you to interact with files by providing a path to the file and specifying the mode in which you want to open the file. Here's the basic syntax of the open() function:  \n",

    "Ans:  \n",
    "The close() function in programming is used to explicitly close a file that has been opened using the open() function. It is important to close a file after you have finished working with it for several reasons: \n",
    "  \n",
    "Release Resources: Free up memory and file handles allocated by the operating system for the open file.  \n",
    "Flush Buffers: Ensure that data you've written is actually saved to the file and not just buffered in memory.  \n",
    "Prevent Data Corruption: Safeguard against potential data corruption if the program terminates unexpectedly.  \n",
    "Release Locks: Allow other processes or programs to access the file by releasing any locks.  \n",
