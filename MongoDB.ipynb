    "**Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database. NoSQL databases are a type of database that do not follow the traditional relational database model. Instead, they store data in a more flexible way, such as in documents, key-value pairs, or graphs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, which means that data is stored in JSON-like documents. Documents are collections of key-value pairs, and they can be nested to represent complex data structures.  \n",
    "MongoDB is a popular choice for applications that need to store large amounts of data, such as social media platforms, e-commerce websites, and gaming applications. It is also a good choice for applications that need to store unstructured data, such as text documents, images, and videos.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are some of the advantages of using MongoDB over SQL databases:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: MongoDB's document-oriented data model is more flexible than the relational data model. This makes it easier to store and query unstructured data.  \n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is highly scalable and can be easily scaled to handle large amounts of data.  \n",
    "Performance: MongoDB is generally faster than SQL databases for read and write operations.  \n",
    "Ease of use: MongoDB is easier to learn and use than SQL databases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing large amounts of unstructured data: MongoDB is a good choice for storing large amounts of data that does not have a fixed schema, such as text documents, images, and videos.  \n",
    "Building real-time applications: MongoDB is a good choice for building real-time applications that need to process large amounts of data quickly.  \n",
    "Developing web applications: MongoDB is a good choice for developing web applications that need to store and query large amounts of data.  \n",
    "Creating a data lake: MongoDB can be used to create a data lake, which is a repository of raw data that can be used for analysis and machine learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are some of the disadvantages of using MongoDB over SQL databases:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Not as ACID compliant: MongoDB does not guarantee ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) properties for all operations. This can be a problem for some applications that require strong consistency guarantees.  \n",
    "Not as mature as SQL databases: MongoDB is a newer database technology than SQL databases, and it does not have the same level of maturity and support.  \n",
    "Not as widely used as SQL databases: SQL databases are more widely used than MongoDB, so there are more resources available for learning and using them.  "

    "the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-oriented data model: MongoDB stores data in documents, which are similar to JSON objects. This makes it easy to store and query unstructured data.  \n",
    "Flexible schema: MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, so you can add or remove fields from documents as needed. This makes it a good choice for applications that need to store evolving data.  \n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is highly scalable and can be easily scaled to handle large amounts of data. It can be horizontally scaled by adding more servers, or vertically scaled by adding more resources to each server.  \n",
    "Performance: MongoDB is generally faster than SQL databases for read and write operations. This is because it does not need to perform joins or other complex operations when querying data.  \n",
    "Replication: MongoDB supports replication, which means that data is stored on multiple servers. This ensures that data is always available even if one server fails.  \n",
    "Security: MongoDB supports a variety of security features, such as authentication, authorization, and encryption. This helps to protect your data from unauthorized access.  \n",
    "Document validation: MongoDB supports document validation, which allows you to specify the required and prohibited fields for each document. This helps to ensure the quality of your data.  \n",
    "Aggregation framework: MongoDB's aggregation framework provides a powerful way to process data. It can be used to perform complex queries, such as finding the top 10 products by sales or calculating the average age of customers.  \n",
    "Geospatial support: MongoDB supports geospatial data, which means that you can store and query data about points, lines, and polygons. This makes it a good choice for applications that need to track location data.  "
